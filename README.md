# Viscoelastic Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks (vCANNs)
This is the GitHub Repository for the paper "Viscoelastic Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks (vCANNs) â€“ a framework for data-driven anisotropic nonlinear finite viscoelasticity", K.P. Abdolazizi, K. Linka, C.J. Cyron, Journal of Computational Physics: 499:112704, 2024.

Besides the source code, this repo contains a minimal working example that illustrates most of the features of vCANN using the uniaxial loading-unloading data of VHB 4910 also used in the paper. After training, the training and validation results should resemble the figure below. Note that the deviations in sub-figure (d) are due to inconsistencies in the experimental data, as discussed in detail in the paper.
